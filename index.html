            <p class="sectionSubTagtext-small">Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing,
                debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived
                artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the
                programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the
                term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software
                engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is
                a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and
                re-create/re-implement.[3] .</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTagtext-small">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
                executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing task or to perform a specific task.
                Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and
                resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly
                referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are
                intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
                processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the
                performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving
                a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects,
                including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTagtext-small">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th
                century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an
                automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer
                Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to
                play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[6][7] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could
                produce entirely different weaves by changing the program â€“ a series of pasteboard cards with holes
                punched in them. </p>
